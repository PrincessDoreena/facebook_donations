This program can keep track of donations. It displays the progress of the charity in a facebook livestream.
The stream contains an illustration of a box filled with coins. The closer the charity is to its goal
the more coins are displayed in the box. An animated wordcloud of the names of the donators is also
displayed.

Makes use of https://pypi.org/project/wordcloud/
